			My name's Logan and I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from Newcastle University. 
		</p>
		<p>
			My professional experience predominantly falls with backend work in C#.NET, but I have dabbled in a few different languages and technologies over the past few years of study and I am always looking to pick up something new.

<p>Tech used: <strong>C&#43;&#43;</strong></p>

<p>This was my introduction to C++. The purpose of this coursework was to practice implementation of an inheritance hierarchy and use of polymorphism in C++ and introduce ideas of 2D collision detection in computer games. I also made use of unit testing and operator overloading, things I had not done before.</p>
<p>Ultimate Chess in this case can be briefly summarised as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate a square playing field</li>
<li>Determine how many rounds a game should play for</li>
<li>Generate a set number of each kind of chess piece (Rook, Bishop, Queen)</li>
<li>For each round, move every piece on the board in a random direction by a random distance, ensuring that the movement is valid for the piece. A Rook can move horizontally and vertically only, a Bishop can move diagonally only, and a Queen can move like the Rook and Bishop combined.</li>
<li>Check for collisions, remove any pieces hit from the board, and increment the counter for the piece currently in motion</li>
<li>The game ends when either the maximum amount of moves has been hit, or only one piece remains standing.</li>
<li>The score for each piece is then output to the console window</li>
</ol>
<p>A screencap of the game in play is as follows.</p>
<p><img src="/img/ultimate-chess/gameplay_01.png" alt="Gameplay in console"></p>
<p>At the start of the screencap, there are only 12 pieces left on the board. On round 25, 3 collisions take place.</p>
