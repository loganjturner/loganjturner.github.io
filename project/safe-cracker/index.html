			My name's Logan and I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from Newcastle University. 
		</p>
		<p>
			My professional experience predominantly falls with backend work in C#.NET, but I have dabbled in a few different languages and technologies over the past few years of study and I am always looking to pick up something new.

<p>Tech used: <strong>VDM-SL, Isabelle</strong></p>
<p>[ <a href="https://github.com/loganjturner/safe-cracker">GitHub</a> ]</p>
<p>Slightly different in that no program was created, this project looked at modelling how an optimal (or close to) program would solve a Safecracker 40 puzzle.</p>

<p>The model was built using VDM-SL in <a href="https://www.overturetool.org/">Overture</a>. After it was built and tested, I began translating it into <a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/">Isabelle</a>, a proof assistant. From a correct translation, the VDM model could be improved further to create a more optimised version of it. The goal would be that after the model has been built and proven, it could then be translated into a real life program.</p>
<p>The module I did this coursework for was called Software Verification, and it taught the importance of building a solid model for a project before jumping straight into development. It helps to reduce the amount of tearing down and rebuilding of code if its based on a mathematically-correct model.</p>
