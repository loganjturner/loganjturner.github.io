			My professional experience predominantly falls with backend work in C#.NET, but I have dabbled in a few different languages and technologies over the past few years of study and I am always looking to pick up something new.

<p><img src="/img/planet-destruction/preview.png" alt="Preview"></p>
<p>Tech used: <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong></p>
<p>No GitHub link as the file is too large (2GB!) / [ <a href="https://youtu.be/HOlAQVFcYwk">YouTube Demo</a> ]</p>
<p>My dissertation explored real-time physics destruction within video games, specifically on a planetary scale. I taught myself how to use Unreal Engine 4 from scratch with its then-experimental Chaos physics system.</p>
<p>I made as much of the project as I could procedurally &ndash; from having half a million star instances to create the night sky to manipulating shaders, creating the appearance of textured, rotating planets.</p>
<p>This was an unbelievably challenging project that I wish I had an extra month or so for to really polish it and make it perform a lot better, however, I&rsquo;m proud of how much progress I made in such a short period of time and I had a lot of fun making this demo.</p>
<p>I earned a 2:1 for my dissertation (65%), earning a first class grade overall.</p>
<p>I also created a poster for my project in Adobe Photoshop 2020.</p>

<hr>
<p>Please note that this project was built with <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/Blueprints/">Blueprints</a> and not raw C++.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve zipped up the source code and have it saved on my Google Drive. If you would like access to it, please email me, and I will send a link to the file. To open, please ensure you have the correct version of Unreal Engine installed from the Epic Games Launcher: 4.26-Chaos, Preview 3.</p>
