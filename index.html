			My professional experience predominantly falls with backend work in C#.NET, but I have dabbled in a few different languages and technologies over the past few years of study and I am always looking to pick up something new.

My dissertation explored real-time physics destruction within video games, specifically on a planetary scale. I taught myself how to use Unreal Engine 4 from scratch with its then-experimental Chaos physics system.
I made as much of the project as I could procedurally &ndash; from having half a million star instances to create the night sky to manipulating shaders, creating the appearance of textured, rotating planets.

This was my introduction to C++. The purpose of this coursework was to practice implementation of an inheritance hierarchy and use of polymorphism in C++ and introduce ideas of 2D collision detection in computer games. I also made use of unit testing and operator overloading, things I had not done before.
Ultimate Chess in this case can be briefly summarised as:
 Generate a square playing field Determine how many rounds a game should play for Generate a set number of each kind of chess piece (Rook, Bishop, Queen) For each round, move every piece on the board in a random direction by a random distance, ensuring that the movement is valid for the piece.

Slightly different in that no program was created, this project looked at modelling how an optimal (or close to) program would solve a Safecracker 40 puzzle.

The model was built using VDM-SL in Overture. After it was built and tested, I began translating it into Isabelle, a proof assistant. From a correct translation, the VDM model could be improved further to create a more optimised version of it.

Easily one of the most fun pieces of coursework I completed over the course of my degree.
Given a cube mesh file, the task was to destroy it using OpenGL shaders. Many different kinds of shaders were used: vertex and fragment shaders were used in all destruction options, with tessellation evaluation, tessellation control, and geometry shaders being used in more complex destructive scenes.
